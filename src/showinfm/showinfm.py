    Open the file manager and show zero or more directories or files in it.

    The path_or_uri is a sequence of items, or a single item. An item can
    be a regular path, or a URI.

    On non-Windows platforms, regular paths will be converted to URIs when
    passed as command line arguments to the file manager, because some file
    managers do not handle regular paths correctly. However, URIs will be
    convereted to paths to handle file managers that do not accept URIs.

    On Windows, Explorer is called using the Win32 API.

    On WSL1, all paths are opened using Windows Explorer. URIs can be
    specified using Linux or Windows formats. All formats are automatically
    converted to use the Windows URI format.

    WSL2 functions the same as WSL1, except if the WSL2 instance has a Linux
    file manager installed. On these systems, if a path on Linux is
    specified, that file manager will be used instead of Windows Explorer.
    Override this default behavior by using the parameter file_manager.

    The most common use of this function is to call it without specifying
    the file manager to use, which defaults to the value returned by
    valid_file_manager()

    For file managers unable to select files to display, the file manager
    will instead display the contents of the path.

    For file managers that can handle file selections, but only one at a time,
    multiple file manager windows will be opened.

    If a file manager executable is specified and this package does not
    recognize it, the executable will be called with the files as the only command
    line arguments.

    :param path_or_uri: zero or more files or directories to open, specified
     as a single URI or valid path, or a sequence of URIs/paths.
    :param open_not_select_directory: if the URI or path is a directory and
     not a file, open the directory itself in the file manager, rather than
     selecting it and displaying it in its parent directory.
    :param file_manager: executable name to use. If not specified, then
     valid_file_manager() will determine which file manager to use.
    :param allow_conversion: allow this function to automatically convert paths
     and URIs to the format needed by the file manager that will be called. Set
     to False if passing non-standard URIs. Ignored when running under WSL.
